ALBUM GALLERY APP ðŸ“¸
Welcome to the Album Gallery Application! ðŸš€

This web application was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and utilizes JSON APIs to provide you with a seamless and interactive experience. The Album Gallery App consists of three main pages:

1. User Page ðŸ§‘
The User Page is your entry point into the app. Here, you'll find information about the users associated with the albums and photos. It provides a brief overview of the users and acts as a gateway to explore albums and photos associated with each user.


2. Album Page ðŸ“š
The Album Page lets you explore various albums. Albums are collections of photos grouped together. You can select a user, view their albums, and dive into the world of photos captured by them. It's a delightful way to explore and organize photos.


3. Photos Page ðŸ“·
The Photos Page is where you get to see the visual beauty captured in photos. After selecting an album, you'll be taken to the Photos Page, where you can view and appreciate each image. This page provides a fullscreen view of photos, allowing you to enjoy them in all their glory.


Feel free to navigate through these pages, explore different users, albums, and photos. The Album Gallery App is designed to make your visual journey enjoyable and engaging.
